I feel like this should be much more straight forward and I have been trying to figure this out for hours.  When coding in VS code I am able to open up the index page and it shows links to all three recipe pages.  I click on the recipe and it taks me to those pages.  Everything has been pushed to Git and appears to be up to date in Git.  When I publish my site on Git, I am taken to the index page but clicking on each link results in a 404 page.
